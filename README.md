Redux [enhancer](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html) for handling side effects.
 
**Warning: API is not stable yet, will be from version 1.0**

## Installation ##
Redux Executor requires **Redux 3.1.0 or later.**
```sh
npm install --save redux-executor
```
This assumes that youâ€™re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like 
[Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume 
[CommonJS modules](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html).

To enable Redux Executor, use `createExecutorEnhancer` with `createStore`:
```js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { createExecutorEnhancer } from 'redux-executor';
import rootReducer from './reducers/index';
import rootExecutor from './executors/index';

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  createExecutorEnhancer(rootExecutor)
);
```

## Motivation ##
There are many clever solutions to deal with side-effects in redux application like [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
or [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga). The goal of this library is to be simpler than **redux-saga**
and also easier to test and more pure than **redux-thunk**.

Typical usage of executor is to fetch some external resource, for example list of posts. It can look like this:
```js
import { handleCommand } from 'redux-executor';
import { postApi } from './api/postApi';
import { postsRequested, postsResolved, postsRejected } from './actions/postActions';

// postsExecutor.js
function fetchPostsExecutor(command, dispatch, state) {
  dispatch(postsRequested());
  
  return postApi.list(command.payload.page)
  .then((posts) => dispatch(postsResolved(posts)))
  .catch((error) => dispatch(postsRejected(error)));
}

export default handleCommand('FETCH_POSTS()', fetchPostsExecutor);

// somwhere else in code
dispatch(fetchPosts(this.state.page));
```
So what is the difference between executor and thunk? With executors you have separation between side-effect _request_ and
side-effect _call_. It means that you can omit second phase and don't call side-effect (if you not bind executor to the store).
With this design it's very easy to write unit tests. If you use [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
it will be also easier to debug - all commands will be logged in debugger. 

I recommend to use redux-executor with [redux-detector](https://github.com/piotr-oles/redux-detector) library. 
In this combination you can for example detect if client is on given url and dispatch fetch command. 
All, excluding executors, will be pure.

## Concepts ##
### An Executor ###
It may sounds a little bit scary but there is nothing to fear - executor is very pure and simple function.
```typescript
type Executor<S> = (command: ActionLike, dispatch: ExecutableDispatch<S>, state: S | undefined) => Promise<void> | void;
```
Like you see above, executor takes an action (called **command** in executors), enhanced `dispatch` function and state.
It can return a `Promise` to provide custom execution flow.

### A Command ###
Command is an **action** with specific `type` format - `COMMAND_TYPE()` (like function call, instead of `COMMAND_TYPE`). The idea behind
is that it's more clean to split actions to two types: normal actions (we will call it _events_) that tells
what **has happened** and _commands_ that tells what **should happen**. 

Events are declarative like: `{ type: 'USER_CLICKED_FOO' }`, commands are imperative like: `{ type: 'FETCH_FOO()' }`.

The reaction for event is state reduction (by reducer) which is pure, the reaction for command is executor call which is
unpure.

Another thing is that events changes state (by reducer), commands not. Because of that command dispatch doesn't call
store listeners (for example it doesn't re-render React application).

## Composition ##
You can pass only one executor to the store, but with `combineExecutors` and `reduceExecutors` you can mix them to
one executor. For example:
```js
import { combineExecutors, reduceExecutors } from 'redux-executor';
import { fooExecutor } from './fooExecutor';
import { barExecutor } from './barExecutor';
import { anotherExecutor } from './anotherExecutor';

// our state has shape:
// {
//   foo: [],
//   bar: 1
// }
//
// We want to bind `fooExecutor` and `anotherExecutor` to `state.foo` branch (they should run in sequence)
// and also `barExecutor` to `state.bar` branch.

export default combineExecutors({
  foo: reduceExecutors(
    fooExecutor,
    anotherExecutor
  ),
  bar: barExecutor
});
```

## API ##
#### combineExecutors ####
```typescript
type ExecutorsMap<S> = {
  [K in keyof S]: Executor<S[K]>;
};

function combineExecutors<S>(map: ExecutorsMap<S>): Executor<S>;
```
Binds executors to state branches and combines them to one executor. Executors will be called in 
sequence but promise will be resolved in parallel (by `Promise.all`) Useful for re-usable executors.

#### createExecutorEnchancer ####
```typescript
type StoreExecutableEnhancer<S> = (next: StoreEnhancerStoreCreator<S>) => StoreEnhancerStoreExecutableCreator<S>;
type StoreEnhancerStoreExecutableCreator<S> = (reducer: Reducer<S>, preloadedState: S) => ExecutableStore<S>;

function createExecutorEnhancer<S>(executor: Executor<S>): StoreExecutableEnhancer<S>;
```
Creates new [redux enhancer](http://redux.js.org/docs/Glossary.html#store-enhancer) that extends redux store api (see [ExecutableStore](#executable-store))

#### ExecutableDispatch ####
```typescript
interface ExecutableDispatch<S> extends Dispatch<S> {
  <A extends Action>(action: A): A & { promise?: Promise<void> };
}
```
It's type of enhanced dispatch method that can add `promise` field to returned action if you dispatch command.

#### ExecutableStore ####
```typescript
interface ExecutableStore<S> extends Store<S> {
  dispatch: ExecutableDispatch<S>;
  replaceExecutor(nextExecutor: Executor<S>): void;
}
```
It's type of enhanced store that has enhanced dispatch method (see [ExecutableDispatch](#executable-dispatch)) and 
`replaceExecutor` method (like `replaceReducer`).

#### Executor ####
```typescript
type Executor<S> = (command: ActionLike, dispatch: ExecutableDispatch<S>, state: S | undefined) => Promise<void> | void;
```
See [Concepts / An Executor](#an-executor)

#### handleCommand ####
```typescript
function handleCommand<S>(type: string, executor: Executor<S>): Executor<S>;
```
Limit executor to given command type (inspired by [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions)).

#### handleCommands ####
```typescript
type ExecutorPerCommandMap<S> = {
  [type: string]: Executor<S>;
};

function handleCommands<S>(map: ExecutorPerCommandMap<S>): Executor<S>;
```
Similar to `handleCommand` but works for multiple commands at once. 
Map is an object where key is a command type, value is an executor (inspired by [redux-actions](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions)).

#### isCommand ####
```typescript
function isCommand(object: any): boolean;
```
Checks if given object is an command (`object.type` ends with `()` string).

#### mountExecutor ####
```typescript
function mountExecutor<S1, S2>(selector: (state: S1 | undefined) => S2, executor: Executor<S2>): Executor<S1>;
```
Mounts executor to some state branch. Useful for re-usable executors.

#### reduceExecutors ####
```typescript
function reduceExecutors<S>(...executors: Executor<S>[]): Executor<S>;
```
Reduces multiple executors to one. Executors will be called in sequence but promise will be resolved in parallel 
(by `Promise.all`). Useful for re-usable executors.


## Code Splitting ##
Redux Executor provides `replaceExecutor` method on `ExecutableStore` interface (store created by Redux Executor). It's similar to
`replaceReducer` - it changes executor and dispatches `{ type: '@@executor/INIT()' }`.

## Typings ##
If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you don't have to install typings - they are provided in npm package.
